# My Blog Website

Welcome to the repository for the blog website! This project uses React.js, WordPress, GraphQL, and Docker to create a modern and dynamic blogging platform.


## Overview

This project is a blog website that leverages the power of React.js for the frontend, GraphQL for querying data efficiently, and Docker for containerization. The combination of these technologies results in a performant, scalable, and maintainable blogging platform.

## Features

- **Modern UI:** The website boasts a responsive and visually appealing user interface built using React.js. Users can enjoy a seamless browsing experience across various devices.

- **Rich Content:** WordPress serves as the backend content management system, allowing you to easily create, edit, and manage blog posts, pages, and other content types.

- **Efficient Data Fetching:** GraphQL is employed to fetch data from WordPress in a highly efficient manner. This leads to faster page load times and reduced data overhead.

- **Containerized Deployment:** The project is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent deployment across different environments and making it easier to manage dependencies.

## Technologies

- **React.js:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It's used to create the frontend of the blog website.

- **WordPress:** A versatile content management system that provides an intuitive interface for managing and publishing content.

- **GraphQL:** A query language for APIs that enables more efficient data fetching by allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.

- **Docker:** A platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers, ensuring consistent deployment and isolation of dependencies.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd my-blog-website`.
3. Install dependencies for the React.js frontend: `npm install`.
4. Configure and set up your WordPress instance.
5. Update the GraphQL endpoint in the React.js code to point to your WordPress GraphQL API.
6. Build the React.js frontend: `npm run build`.

## Usage

Once you have set up the project, you can:

- Run the React.js development server: `npm start`.
- Access the website in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

Feel free to customize the website's appearance, add new features, and tailor it to your specific needs.

## Deployment

To deploy the blog website using Docker:

1. Make sure you have Docker installed and running.
2. Build the Docker container: `docker build -t my-blog-website .`
3. Run the Docker container: `docker run -p 80:80 my-blog-website`

The website should now be accessible at `http://localhost` in your browser.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
